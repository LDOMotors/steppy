# Print Instructions
* There are two options for printing steppy: unibody and multibody. 
* Multibody separates the frame into 3 individual parts allowing for a multicoloured end product. 
* Print either option using any material and any colour you wish! Recommended infill is 20% or above.
* The printed shaft is only needed if you don't have the 5mm stainless steel shaft (included in LDO kits).
* There is a hole in the back of the frame to loop an optional lanyard.
